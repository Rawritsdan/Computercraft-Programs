Computercraft-Programs
======================
-- Readme is WIP!

Hello and welcome to the repo for my computercraft and other lua related programs.

***This code is very experimental, basic and a bit rubbish!***

As mentioned above this code is not going to be glamourous or very well written, it is code (that tries) to get the job done. The code may also feature snippets from other developers, credit given where needed. Feel free to give me suggestions on improving, ideas to implement and try not to shout too much if I get it completely and utterly wrong!
Unless stated otherwise you can use, modify and distribute, although I would appreciate a little shout out.

At the moment, I am using:

	- FTB Unleashed (Version 1.1.6, based on Minecraft 1.5.2) Yes it's 																		old but I'm having problems with my computer.
	- A few extra mods
		- {Mod 1}
		- {Mod 2}
	- Java {Version}
